A marvelous implementation for the 'snake' game written in Javascript.
What is different than most other implementations is that I added
an explosion functionality so that either 'eating food', crashing into
wall, or crashing into self creates a 'pleasant' explosion without
the use of images by utilizing the canvas element along with the
save and restore methods.
